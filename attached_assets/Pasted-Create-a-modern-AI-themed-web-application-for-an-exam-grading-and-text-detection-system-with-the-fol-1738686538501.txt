Design Theme
Color Scheme: Futuristic gradient palette (electric blue → neon purple → white) with holographic accents

AI Patterns:

Background: Animated neural network connections + floating circuit board SVG patterns

Section dividers: Binary code animations with smooth transitions

Typography: Clean sans-serif (Inter font) with tech-inspired headings

Animations:

Hover effects: Button glow + card elevation

Page transitions: Smooth parallax scrolling

Loading states: AI brain SVG loader

Components
Navigation:

Dynamic nav bar with:

Hover-activated gradient underline

Floating AI assistant icon (sparks on click)

Role-specific menu items (auto-hide irrelevant links)

Access Control:

Strict role-based routing (students never see professor dashboard)

Session management with JWT tokens

Responsive Design:

Mobile-optimized layouts with collapsible AI visualizations

Technical Requirements
Frontend: React.js with Framer Motion + Three.js for animations

Backend: Node.js/Express API endpoints for file processing
